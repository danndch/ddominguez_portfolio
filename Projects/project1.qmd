## Data Science delveig into Data Engineering 

In the rapidly evolving world of Data, where the ability to turn vast amounts of raw data into actionable insights is highly prized. You may know Python, you may know R, but mastering the language of data and understanding the architecture that supports it are not just an advantage but it is essential. SQL and data engineering, is a realm that it is close to Data Science and there are some skills that will set you apart in your future career.

## Why SQL?

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is the cornerstone of data manipulation and retrieval. It's the bridge between the questions you seek to answer and the data that contains those answers. Whether it's understanding customer behavior, predicting market trends, or improving operational efficiency, SQL empowers you to:

* Access Critical Data Quickly: Navigate through complex databases with ease, ensuring that no source of insight is beyond your reach.
* Communicate Effectively with Data: Speak the universal language understood by databases worldwide, making your analyses more versatile and impactful.
* Refine Your Analytical Precision: Hone your ability to ask nuanced questions of your data, enabling more precise, targeted analyses.


## The Value of Data Engineering Skills

As Data Scientists, our vision is only as clear as the data at our disposal. Data engineering skills could ensure that the data we rely on is accurate, accessible, and ready for analysis. By understanding data pipelines, storage solutions, and data processing, we will:

* Enhance Data Quality and Accessibility: Ensure that the data you use for your analyses is clean, well-structured, and readily available, reducing the time from question to insight.
* Scale Your Data Efforts: Tackle larger datasets and more complex problems with confidence, knowing that your data infrastructure is robust and scalable.
* Bridge the Gap Between Data and Decision-Making: Play that role in translating data insights into strategic actions, making your contributions invaluable to any team.
* You don't want to sit and wait: If you provide to your employer a solution more than waiting for the Data Engineer to give you the data you need to work, what if you could provide that solution as well, not having to depend a 100% on someone else gives you freedome and a higher value in the market.


## Your Path to Becoming a Data Science Hybrid with Data Engineering 

Embracing SQL and and some other data engineering concepts is not just about enlarging your technical toolbox; it's about expanding your problem-solving skillset. In a data-driven world, these skills enable you to navigate and make sense of the multiple situations, turning data into information which will become decisions that drive progress.

## Now where is this being used?

### Top industry

Lets take a look at two positions open at TESLA for an internship, they are in the same job post but they ask for two different positions.

If we were to look into a Ven Diagram we could picture Data Science on one of the sides and Data Engineering in the other, this is it could be taken from out the descriptions and put it into the Data Science or Data Engineering side

#### Skills and Tasks Specific to a Data Scientist:

Statistical Learning and Bayesian Models: The mention of statistical learning and Bayesian models is more aligned with the data scientist role, where a deep understanding of statistical methods and the ability to apply these methods to extract insights from data is crucial.
Answering Complex Questions on Fleet Usage and Behavior: This involves not just accessing and processing data but also interpreting it in a way that provides actionable insights, which is a core part of a data scientist's role.
MLOps Skills: While MLOps can be relevant to both roles, in the context of deploying and managing machine learning models, it leans more towards the data scientist side, especially when it involves model development, validation, and iteration based on statistical principles.


#### Skills and Tasks Specific to a Data Engineer:

Building Scalable Data Pipelines: The emphasis on building scalable data pipelines for deploying fleet health monitoring models is a essential data engineering task, focusing on the infrastructure that allows for efficient data flow and processing.
Data ELT Pipelines Using Airflow: Creating and maintaining data Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) pipelines, especially with tools like Airflow, is a key data engineering responsibility, ensuring that data is regularly and reliably prepared for analysis.
Query Optimization and Advanced SQL: While SQL is used by both data scientists and data engineers, the focus on optimizing and undertaking advanced SQL queries, especially on massive datasets, is more characteristic of data engineering, which often deals with the optimization of data access and processing.

#### Skills and Tasks Shared Between Both Roles:

Data Analytics and Infrastructure: Both roles involve a level of responsibility for employing data to drive insights and actions, which includes the infrastructure that supports data analytics.
Use of Tableau and Similar Tools for Dashboards: The creation and maintenance of analytics dashboards are common to both roles, although the focus might differ; data scientists would be more involved in the interpretation of the data, while data engineers would ensure the data is accurately and efficiently presented.
Working with Cross-Functional Teams: Collaboration with cross-functional teams to support design cycles, provide insights, and support decision-making is essential for both roles, though the nature of the support and insights provided may vary.

#### The difference

The job description establishes a range for the payment, it goes from $20-60 an hour. Just imagine that for being able to understand skills like ETL, stablishing a pipeline (Which is ETL), and sharp your SQL could give you 3 times more money, and you could fix your problems in less time than waiting for someone to complement this tasks, if you are hired of course.
